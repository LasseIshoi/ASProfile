# InSituASProfile

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of InSituASProfile is to provide an easy way to calculate the
insitu sprint acceleration-speed profile based on gps data from the
concept described by Morin et al.Â 2021 published in Journal of
Biomechanics, DOI: 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110524

## Installation

You can install the development version of InSituASProfile from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LasseIshoi/ASProfile")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to use the InSituASProfile Package:

If you have csv files from a single player located in a folder, you can
use the InSituASProfile::import_data function, which basically list
files from a folder, and combine into a single data frame. YOu need to
specify the names of velocity and acceleration columns. If for example
you have Catapult as a gps provider, this process can be streamlined
easily using the API (click
[here](https://www.lasseishoi.net/post/force-velocity/) for an example).

## Prepare data

This step cleans the data frame by 1) omitting all acceleration values
below 0, 2) identify the two highest acceleration values for every
consecutive 0.1 m/s cut starting from 3 m/s, and 3) create an initial
regression line and associated preliminary plot (if not FALSE)

``` r

InSituASProfile::prepare_data(data_import, print_plot = TRUE)
```

## Calculate the AS Profile

Calculate the A-S Profile. This step uses the data exported from
prepare_data, and to calculate the A-S Profile. It plots the A-S Profile
as default (TRUE), while a plot showing the regression line is not
printed by default (FALSE). By default data is cleaned using the removal
of points outside of the 95 % Confidence Intervals of the initial
regression line (ci_outlier_detection = TRUE), or using the Turkey
Boxplot method, which removes points outside of the IQR \* 1.5 including
the top 2 percent of points for each velocity bin.

### CI Method

``` r

InSituASProfile::get_AS_Profile(print_plot_regression_line = FALSE, 
                                print_AS_plot = TRUE, 
                                ci_outlier_detection = TRUE)
```

### Boxplot Method

``` r

InSituASProfile::get_AS_Profile(print_plot_regression_line = FALSE, 
                                print_AS_plot = TRUE, 
                                ci_outlier_detection = FALSE)
```
